# Final-POE
The final section to the 3 part POE for programming 6221
In this part of the POE, a user inteface was added using WPF.
This makes the application easy to use for all users. 
The application was made to add and stire recipes.
The recipes addded will then also be able to be displayed to the user if the user requests.
The user is also able to filter through the recipes using either the name of an ingredient, food group of the ingredient or the total number of calories used in the recipe.
If the user does not want to use the application anymore, they are given the option to close the application.
